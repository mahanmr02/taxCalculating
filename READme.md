1.for watching my user stories you need to send me an email with the email you want to access to it

--> gmail : mahanclash8195@gmail.com

(if u can't, all u need to do is open the folder named user stories and see some images and text from that project)

2.for watching my test cases u need to copy the link below and use it on your browser to download the excel file:

--> link : https://app.testomat.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMXJNQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9eab04f96784c2f8ee4247cda1b57288833acdff/Tax%20Calculator%20dump%20at%202024-11-20%2014-22-41%20UTC.xlsx?disposition=attachment

(i already pushed it into the files too)
(there is also test cases folder with images that u can see the cases if you don't wanna watch it on excel) :)
